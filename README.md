> ABOUT: A job posts scraper that uses SerpAPI to surface relevant job posts for a given
input. Designed for the community of 7K remote workers that I run on Telegram. 

> WORK-IN-PROGRESS: I have added the underlying script, an Express.js backend, a
gSQL database, and I'm currently still working out the React frontend.

> LIMITATIONS: Using custom inputs for search query and exclude query is not yet supported but I'm planing to add that in the near future. ##
